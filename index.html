        <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
        <p>I am a professional musician who has recently decided to pursue a career in software engineering. I've been playing the viola for over 20 years, I freelance in Southern Indiana, and I am a founding member of the Cercis String Quartet. My interest in coding came from using a text based music notation software that works just like writing in a programming language. Several online tutorials later, I am now enrolled in the Rithm School to learn the ins and outs of front-end web development.</p>
        <p>I love the creativity of playing music and coding, but you can also see me flex that creativity in the kitchen with my cooking and baking.</p>
